# Histogram Equalization - Digital Logic Design Project
Personal submission for the 2020/21 **Final Examination** of the **Digital Logic Design** (**Reti Logiche**) course at **Politecnico di Milano**.

ðŸ“… **Developed in**: December 2020

âœ… **Final Grade**: 30 cum laude
## About
This project consisted in designing and implementing a synchronous hardware module with a given interface, whose purpose is to use the **Histogram Equalization Method** to increase the contrast of a grayscale image stored in memory.

The repo also contains the [Testbench Generator](https://github.com/albertoboffi/polimi-digital-logic-design-project/tree/main/tools/testbench-generator) specifically designed for this project.

The development was supported by the **Xilinx Vivado v2020.2** suite.
