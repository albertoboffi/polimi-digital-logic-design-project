# Histogram Equalization - Digital Logic Design Project
Personal submission for the 2020/21 **Final Examination** of the **Digital Logic Design** course at **Politecnico di Milano**.

ðŸ“… **Developed in**: December 2020

âœ… **Final Grade**: 30 cum laude
## About
The project consisted in designing and implementing a synchronous hardware module with a given interface, whose purpose is to use the **Histogram Equalization Method** to increase the contrast of a grayscale image stored in memory.

The project was developed through the **Xilinx Vivado v2020.2** suite.

For further information about the development, please refer to the [Project Report](https://github.com/albertoboffi/polimi-digital-logic-design-project/blob/main/report.pdf).

**Note**: The Digital Logic Design course is held in Italian, so the documentation is not available in English.
